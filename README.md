# Multiscale Atlas of Gene Expression for Integrative Cortical Cartography

Welcome to the Multiscale Atlas of Gene Expression for Integrative Cortical Cartography! This repository contains the data and code used to visualise the comprehensive maps of cortical gene expression

Overview
The atlas was generated using a combination of in situ hybridization and RNA sequencing techniques. The resulting data was then integrated using a spatial transcriptomics approach to create a comprehensive, multi-scale map of gene expression in the mouse cortex.

The atlas includes gene expression data at four different scales: the whole-brain level, the cortical area level, the layer level, and the cellular level. The data can be accessed through an interactive web-based interface, which allows users to explore gene expression patterns across different scales and brain regions.

Data and Code
The data and code used to generate the atlas are provided in this repository. The data includes raw and processed gene expression data in multiple formats, as well as annotation files and other metadata. The code includes scripts and pipelines used to process and integrate the data, as well as tools for visualizing and analyzing the results.

Installation and Usage
To use the atlas, simply navigate to the web-based interface provided on the project website. The interface allows users to browse and search the gene expression data, as well as generate custom visualizations and download data in various formats.

To use the data and code in this repository, you will need to have access to the necessary computational resources and software dependencies. Detailed installation and usage instructions are provided in the README files located in each subdirectory of the repository.
